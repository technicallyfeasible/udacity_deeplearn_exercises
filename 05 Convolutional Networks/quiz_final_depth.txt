For the following quiz questions, consider an input image that is 130x130 (x, y) and 3 in depth (RGB).
Say, this image goes through the following layers in order:

nn.Conv2d(3, 10, 3)
nn.MaxPool2d(4, 4)
nn.Conv2d(10, 20, 5, padding=2)
nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)

After going through all four of these layers in sequence, what is the depth of the final output?
1, 3, 10, 20, or 40?


K*F*F*D_in + K
(W_inâˆ’F+2P)/S+1

130x130
nn.Conv2d(3, 10, 3)
  K=10
  F=3
  D_in=3
    => 280
  W_in=130
  F=3
  S=1
  P=0
    => 128x128x10

nn.MaxPool2d(4, 4)
  => 32x32x10

nn.Conv2d(10, 20, 5, padding=2)
  W_in=32
  F=5
  S=1
  P=2
    => 32x32x20

nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
  => 16x16x20
